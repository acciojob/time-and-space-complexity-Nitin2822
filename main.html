	<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to how efficient an algorithm is by measuring the amount of time it takes to run as the input size increases.An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity.</p>
    <p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. For example, an algorithm that uses extra memory proportional to input size has a space complexity of O(n).
